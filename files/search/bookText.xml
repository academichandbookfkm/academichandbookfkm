                   Assalamualaikum and Salam Sejahtera,

                   you  to  be  skilled  and  competent  engineers
                   with commendable leadership qualities.

                   The main objective of this academic handbook is to be a point of reference for students to
                   understand and get to know both the faculty and the programmes offered at the university,
                   especially in FKM. Students are exposed to the world of knowledge, competency and skills
                   which are blended together to develop their self-esteem in philosophy, creativity and critical
                   thinking, as well as to strengthen their commitments in serving the country. It is also to equip
                   students to be well-prepared in facing challenges and survive in future.

                   1.1      HISTORY

                   On December 1 , 2000, the Ministry of Education of Malaysia has officially approved the

                    3.1    INTRODUCTION


                    The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering offers academic programmes at both undergraduate
                    and  postgraduate  levels.  This  handbook  focuses  on  information  pertaining  to  the
                    undergraduate  programmes.  The  programmes  offered  at  undergraduate  level  are  the
                    Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (BMCG) and the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering
                    (DMC). The normal study periods for BMCG and DMC programmes are four and three years
                    respectively. The curriculum structures of BMCG and DMC programmes are explained in
                    sections 3.6 and 3.8, respectively.

                    Starting from Semester 1 Session 2014/2015, the faculty offers only one bachelor degree
                    programme (BMCG). The purpose of offering a single programme is to produce graduates
                    with  broad  engineering  skills  and  therefore,  highly  adaptable  to  the  job  market.  The
                    specialization of students into various engineering fields will be accomplished through the
                    offering of elective courses in Year 4.

                    The faculty's commitment in providing quality education programme continues by adhering
                    to the guidelines set by the Engineering Accreditation Council of Malaysia (EAC). In addition,
                    the faculty also continues the implementation of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) which has
                    also been used by a large number of leading universities around the world. Using OBE
                    system, the teaching and learning process is tailored to develop balanced graduates based
                    on the objectives set in Programme Educational Objectives (PEO). Every taught course carries
                    a set of learning outcomes (LOs), which students need to achieve upon completion of the
                    course. These LOs are mapped to Programme Outcomes (POs) for assessment purposes.

                    The 1  shift of the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 (Higher Education) is “Producing
                    holistic, entrepreneurial and balanced graduates”. In order to achive this goal, it is essential for
                    UTeM to develop a constructively aligned, holistic and integrated curriculum that embeds High
                    Impact  Educational  Practices  (HIEP),  which  encompasses  cognitive  and  conceptual  clarity,
                    entrepreneurial skills, experiential learning and innovation.

                    In line with the policy of the nation, a new instrument, which is termed as Integrated Cumulative
                    Grade Point Average (iCGPA) is introduced by the Ministry of Higher Education to assess student
                    achievement based on this holistic, entrepreneurial and balanced graduates criteria. This new
                    instrument will be fully implemented starting from semester 1 session 2016/2017 in all public
                    universities.

                    Under the new system, upon graduation students have a comprehensive “report card”. Apart from
                    the conventional numerical CGPA and academic transcript, the report card is also consists of the
                    detailed soft skills that students have gained during their study at the university. These skills include
                    leadership, communication, entrepreneurial, social and critical thinking skills, which is displayed in

                    highly  renumerated,  however  it  demands  great  responsibilities.  Engineers  and  assistant
                    engineers are problem solvers who provide solutions to any engineering problem that arises.
                    In other words, they are knowledgeable people with the ability to solve problems. Hence,
                    mechanical  engineer  must  be  of  very  skilled  person  and  comfortable  with  his  or  her
                    knowledge in mechanical engineering.

                    Mechanical engineering typically exists together with electrical and civil engineering in terms
                    of its historical development. Due to highly ethical and challenging nature of the engineers
                    and  assistant  engineers’  job  scope,  it  gained  a  professional  and  semi  professional
                    recognition.  Therefore  it  is  the  aim  of  every  mechanical  engineer  to  be  recognised
                    professionally in terms of their ability and competency. There are avenues where mechanical
                    engineer can be registered as a Professional Engineer.

                    Engineers  or  assistant  engineers  must  possess  good  ethical  values.  Virtues  are  universal,
                    irrespective of his or her position, place of work or race.  Engineer and assistant engineer
                    must heed those virtues which include sincerity, transparency and consistency. Other qualities

                     Teaching and learning (T&L) activities are conducted in Semester 1 and Semester 2 every
                     year. The T&L activities are planned by Academic Management Division (BPA) on yearly
                     basis and presented in the academic calendar. The academic calendar shows the detail of
                     T&L activities including lectures, semester break, final examination and etc.

                     Teaching and learning are based on specific recognized techniques by which the knowledge
                     is conveyed in an effective manner to the students. The programme will adopt a unique
                     strategy for effective teaching and learning that includes the following aspects:

                        (a) Computer-based teaching
                            This is based on teaching process through computer-based knowledge presentation
                            and computer-based interactions for knowledge acquisition. The objective is to teach
                            the students through the optimum usage of computer to help them acquire specific
                            information  on  any  topic  of  interest  and  develop  understanding  on  specific
                            knowledge  in  any  particular  course.  Example  of  related  course  is  Computer
                            Programming.

                        (b) Problem-based learning
                            Problem-based learning is an instructional approach that has been used successfully
                            for over 30 years and continues to gain acceptance in multiple disciplines including
                            mechanical  engineering.  It  is  an  instructional  (and  curricular)  learner-centered
                            approach  that  empowers  learners  to  conduct  research,  integrate  theory  and
                            practice, and apply knowledge and skills to develop a viable solution to a defined
                            problem. This experience will help elucidate how actual engineering problems are
                            solved. The example of course is Mechanical Design.

                        (c)  Project-based learning
                            Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and
                            skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an




                                                                 92]]></page><page Index="103"><![CDATA[engaging and complex engineering questions and problems. The example of course
                            is Integrated Design Project (IDP).

                        (d) Simulation
                            Simulation-based teaching is another teaching practised by UTeM academic staff in
                            conducting  lectures,  tutorials  and  laboratory  sessions.  This  technique  aims  at
                            supporting  the  tutorials  and  laboratory  sessions  by  facilitating  a  better
                            understanding on the course materials. It consolidates the learning process of the
                            course. Simulation is more relevant to the physical modelling of the problems in
                            certain domains such as those involving dangerous, intricate or expensive processes.
                            Examples  of  courses  using  this  technique  are  Computer  Aided  Design  and
                            Manufacturing, Mechanism Design and Vehicle System Modelling and Simulation.

                        (e) Industrial application software
                            In  addition  to  the  normal  educational  software,  specific  industry  application
                            software, are also used for teaching and learning activities. Lecturers and tutors
                            apply  industry  based  software  packages  in  their  respective  courses  to  expose
                            students  to  the  use  of  industry-related  tools.  The  industry-based  and  academic-
                            based  teaching  and  learning  tools  are  combined  for  the  purpose  of  enriching
                            students’ technical competencies in the courses studied. The examples of the related
                            software are Solidworks, AutoCAD, ANSYS, ABAQUS and MATLAB & SIMULINK.

                        (f)  Industrial exposure
                            Industrial exposure is also given to students. Arrangement is made to enable students
                            of the department to have visit to various relevant manufacturing and engineering
                            companies.  These educational visits give the opportunity to students to have some

                            It is a learning technique based on conducting specific activities in order to find out
                            the solution of a problem under consideration. This learning process may involve
                            theoretical,  experimental,  simulation,  industrial  exposure,  industrial  application
                            software and any other teaching and learning techniques pracitised. Conducting a
                            project is one of the ways to solve an outstanding problem. It is therefore one of the
                            more  effective  teaching  and  learning  techniques  adopted  by  UTeM.  Final  Year
                            Project (Projek Sarjana Muda) course is the best example of this method.  Final Year
                            Project (Projek Sarjana Muda) and Diploma Project (Projek Diploma) courses are the
                            best example of this method.  Final Year Project allows students to apply the basic
                            engineering problem solving skills, which they have learned before.

                        (h) Tutorials
                            Tutorials  are  carried  out  regularly  to  provide  continuous  exercise/practice  to
                            enhance students’ understanding after lecture on each chapter had been completed.
                            Each tutorial session takes one hour per week for 14 weeks.

                     5.4  ASSESSMENT

                     The assessment on learning outcomes in semester system is performed continuously based on
                     the students’ works during the lecture weeks in a semester. Students are expected to be
                     ready  for  any  kind  of  assessment  being  held  during  the  semester.  The  methods  for
                     assessment are through coursework and final semester examination. The final examination
                     is comprehensive in the sense that it covers the entire syllabus learned in the semester. The
                     coursework assessment is a continuous process carried out to evaluate student’s performance
                     throughout the semester. Coursework encompasses among others Problem Based Learning
                     (PBL), quiz, test, assignment, practical work, project, case studies, and industrial visit etc.

                     5.4.1  COURSEWORK

                     Coursework  is  assessed  by  not  more  than  40%  for  degree  programme  and  60%  for
                     diploma programme. Normally the coursework are categorized as:


                                                                 94]]></page><page Index="105"><![CDATA[(a) Mid Semester Examination
                            Mid semester examination is conducted to find out what the students have learned
                            during the first half of the semester. The format of examination may be in form of
                            multiple  choice  questions,  calculation  or  open-ended  questions.  The  processes  of
                            conducting  of  the  mid  semester  examination  is  similar  to  the  final  examination
                            procedures. The marks allocated for this exam is 20% to 30% of the overall marks.
                            Generally, the duration of the examination is from one (1) hour to 1.5 hours. The
                            tentative date of the examination will be announced in the teaching plan which is
                            distributed during the first lecture.

                        (b) Quizzes
                            Quizzes consist of short questions, objective questions, or questions with “fill in the
                            blanks”  techniques  or  simple  question/calculations  which  designed  to  evaluate
                            students’  understanding  during  the  lecture.    Time  allocated  is  approximately  15
                            minutes.

                        (c)  Projects
                            Project or assignment is an efficient way to strengthen the understanding of students
                            for a particular course. It also provides research skill to the students. Project involves
                            activities,  such  as  literature  survey,  methodology  and  some  design  stages.  The
                            project generally requires the students to apply the theory in the real engineering
                            field. At the end of the project, students must submit a project report and present
                            the project. Assessment for the project is based on a written report and presentation
                            by the students.

                        (d) Assignments / Lab Report
                            Assignments or Lab Report are for training individual students for using references
                            and research works and able to present their works in an academic report form. It
                            is also formulated for training the students solving problems related to the topic
                            given and hence updating students’ lecture notes. Coursework could be given to the
                            students in several forms:


                                                                 95]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[i. Design, essay forms or report on specific topic;

                            Other kinds of assessments on coursework could also be considered upon faculty
                            approval.

                     5.4.2  FINAL EXAMINATION

                     The  Final  Examination  is  held  for  two  weeks  at  the  end  of  the  semester.  It  is  the  final
                     evaluation on courses as set by the Faculty. For degree programme, the weightage of the
                     Final Examination shall be no less than 60%. On the other hand for the diploma programme
                     the Final Examination shall be no less than 40%. The duration of the Final Examination

                     Student’s performance in a course is evaluated based on the grade obtained. Grading
                     system is shown in Table 5.5.  Generally, minimum passing grade for a course is Grade D.
                     However  Grade  D  up  to  C-  are  categorised  as  Conditional  Pass  and  the  students  are
                     allowed to improve their grade by repeating the course only once.

                     The students are entitled to Course Withdrawal (TD) from any course if they feel that their
                     performance is poor. The last date for course withdrawal is in week twelve (12). The
                     students are allowed to sit or repeat the course if it is offered by the faculty. With the
                     verification  from  the  Academic  Advisor,  students  can  withdraw  any  registered  course
                     provided that the minimum load of 12 credit hours remains.

                     If the credit hour taken is less than 12 credits and the student decided to withdraw any
                     course, the Faculty’s Dean approval is required.

                     The normal guideline for course withdrawal is as follows:
                          a.    Course withdrawal is allowed within the period regulated by the University.
                                Withdrawal is not encouraged as it reflects the student’s weaknesses in planning
                                for course enrolment and failure to follow the projected credit hours. The Course
                                Withdrawal (TD) status will be printed in the programme registration slip and
                                final transcript.
                          b.    The student is not allowed to withdraw any co-curriculum course.
                          c.    The students are required to re-register for the course that they had withdrawn,
                                except the elective course which can be substituted with other elective courses.
                          d.    Any tuition fees paid (if relevant) prior to withdrawal, will not be refunded.

                     Examples 5 and 6 have shown that the student’s results are affected if the student decided
                     to Withdraw (TD) or continuing taking the course. In Example 6, the student’s GPA will be
                     drastically dropped to 2.28 as compared to 2.72 in Example 5. The withdrawal will also
                     affect the CGPA from 2.72 to 2.55. Therefore the student has to consider carefully when
                     deciding whether or not to withdraw.

                     the courses with a minimum of D grade, the student will still be dismissed since CGPA is less
                     than 1.70.

                     6.1  INTRODUCTION


                     The Academic Advisory System is established for the purpose of providing comprehensive
                     advice in terms of education, teaching and assessment for students during their studies in
                     UTeM. The faculty has established an Academic Advisory Committee which is chaired by the
                     Dean to implement and to monitor this mechanism effectively. The system also involves all
                     FKM academic staffs.


                     6.2  ACADEMIC ADVISORY OBJECTIVES


                     Students in university have life that is totally different from the school environment. Being
                     away  from  family,  relatives  and  old  friends,  students  are  required  to  have  good  self
                     motivation in order to survive and succeed in their studies. The students are also expected
                     to gain information and to adapt quickly with the change of rules in a campus life.

                     Students should therefore utilize the existence of the Academic Advisory System that can
                     help them in their academic achievement. Academic staffs shall be regarded as a friend to
                     seek for advice and opinion.

                     The objectives of Academic Advisory System are:
                           a.   To provide a proper channel for students to obtain an advice and counselling
                                especially on academic problem.
                           b.   To establish two ways of communications between students and
                                faculty/university.
                           c.   For the advisor to recognize the students’ ability and capability.
                           d.   To produce a discipline and balance attitude of students.



                                                                127]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[e.   As a platform for sharing opinion, information and giving advice on the overall
                                aspects of the student’s life in university.

                     6.3  ACADEMIC ADVISORY STRUCTURE


                     The  faculty  has  set  the  Academic  Advisory  System  as  one  of  the  platforms  to  obtain
                     feedback  from  students.  This  is  important  for  the  continuous  improvement  based  on  the
                     positive as well as demanding feedback received from the students. The procedures of the
                     Academic Advisory System are shown in Figure 6.1.

































                                              Figure 6.1 Academic Advisory System


                                                                128]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[There are two important components in the system.  First is the meeting with the students to
                     seek for feedback and second, is for the academics to give advice and to take action
                     related  to  the  student’s  academic  problem  appropriately.  Student’s  feedback  can  be
                     gathered  from  annual  meeting  and  or  personal  meeting.  All  records  such  as  student’s
                     personal and academic information are updated during the meeting and documented in the
                     faculty. There are two meetings organized annually by Academic Advisory Committee and
                     these are chaired by the Dean.

                     The Academic Advisory Committee’s working procedure is as follows:
                     a.    Students will be divided into several groups consisting of 20 to 30 students. Each
                           group  is  led  by  one  Academic  Advisor  (Penasihat  Akademik,  PA).  The  PA  is  an
                           academic staff with teaching experience.
                     b.    PA will remain with the students until they graduate. PA shall be regarded as a mentor
                           for the students.
                     c.    PA  keeps  and  updates  the  students’  records  under  his/her  group.  These  records
                           include academic performances of the students until they graduate. The records also
                           include feedback, application letters as well as issues relating to academic and non-
                           academic. These records are kept by the PA for future reference.


                     6.4  STUDENT’S ACADEMIC ADVISORY MECHANISM


                     Each academic staff should be aware of the objectives of the Academic Advisory System.
                     Formal and informal meeting sessions are important. Students shall be responsive to the
                     faculty’s intention to help them through the following mechanism:
                     a.    Faculty has set minimum 2 formal meetings per semester organized by Academic
                           Advisory Committee for students to meet their PA.
                     b.    Students  can  meet  their  PA  at  their  own  initiative.  More  informal  meetings  are
                           encouraged.




                                                                129]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[c.    Formal  meeting  between  students  and  PA  is  made  by  appointment  or  any  other
                           methods agreed.
                     d.    Detail of the discussion is recorded for future reference.
                     e.    Attendance is compulsory for the meeting organized by their PA.


                     6.5  ACADEMIC ADVISORS RESPONSIBILITY


                     PA has the responsibility to help students with poor academic achievement. Normally, good
                     students are more approachable whilst poor students are difficult to engage for discussion
                     and meeting. From the beginning the students must be aware that academic progress and
                     achievement are their responsibility.

                     The faculty has outlined the role of PA are as follows:
                     a.    Play  an  important  role  in  giving  advice,  guidance  and  motivation  to  students
                           regarding their academic and non-academic matters.
                     b.    Monitor student’s academic development, progress and performance.
                     c.    Schedule meeting which is agreed by both parties.
                     d.    Assist students in understanding the organization structure, method and procedure of
                           university’s administration.
                     e.    Refer to professional counsellor in order to solve student problem, when necessary.
                     f.    Encourage students to be involved in academic and non-academic activities organized
                           by the university.


                     6.6  STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY


                     In the university, students are fully responsible of their achievement in their studies. The
                     student’s responsibilities are as follows:




                                                                130]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[a.    Consistently meet their PA to seek for advice in solving academic and non-academic
                           problems.

                     6.7  LEARNING GUIDANCE IN UNIVERSITY


                     The  learning  environment  in  university  differs  greatly  to  that  in  school.  Students  must
                     therefore adapt to the new learning method accordingly, where most of the time, students
                     are expect to have self motivation and self indepence to learn the materials giving in the
                     class by the lectures. Several measures on how to succeed in the university are pointed out
                     as follows:
                     a.    Manage time effectively. Students should participate in positive activities and stay
                           away from being involved in any illegal activities.
                     b.    Plan-out properly for the courses to be registered for each semester by consulting the
                           PA.
                     c.    Choose  co-curriculum  and  elective  courses  that  are  suitable  according  to  own

                     7.3.3  DRESS CODE

                     Dressing reflects the culture of the working environment. Irrespective of type of working
                     environment,  one  must  dress  appropriately.  The  university  has  distributed  a  general
                     guideline to the students on dress code within the university area. As far as the faculty is
                     concerned, the dress code applies specifically for workshops or laboratories. The detail of
                     the dress code can be referred to the Pejabat Hal Ehwal Pelajar dan Alumni. The following
                     instruction must be carefully observed by the students while they are around or working in
                     the laboratory.
                     a.   Students should always display matrix cards for ease of identification.
                     b.   Students  should  always  wear  appropriate  dress  corresponding  to  the  activities
                          undertaken.
                     c.   Students should always wear proper personal protective equipment such as goggles,
                          hand gloves or aprons while handling high risk equipments.
                     d.   Students must wear covered shoes inside the laboratory. Any uncovered shoes are not
                          allowed at all times.
                     e.   For all activities inside the workshop, student must wear safety shoes.
                     f.   Students are encouraged to wear workshop coat at the laboratory compound. Any

                     7.4  IMPLEMENTATION OF LABORATORY WORK



                     The purpose of laboratory work is to increase student’s understanding on the course thought.
                     A number of laboratories were developed to cater the demand for the courses. In general,
                     the conduct of the laboratory is parallel to the course registered on that particular semester.

                     7.4.1  LABORATORY WORK CONCEPT


                     Each laboratory session is conducted in a period of 14 weeks. During the first week, student
                     will be briefed on the content and how the laboratory will be conducted. Some of the content
                     during the orientation (1 week) period are as follows:
                     a.   Name of laboratory station and how the experimental will be conducted.
                     b.   Number and name of experimental work to be carried out.
                     c.   Brief explanation of the laboratories work.
                     d.   Group formation.
                     e.   Format of report writing and marking scheme.

                     However, there are two approaches of laboratory work which are prescriptive laboratory
                     work and open-ended laboratory work. For prescriptive laboratory activities, the students
                     are provided with complete laboratory sheet and are fully guided by the lecturer or the
                     instructor during the laboratory session. Prescriptive laboratory work will be conducted for
                     diploma laboratory courses. Meanwhile, bachelor laboratory courses will implement open-
                     ended approach. In this approach, the students will be given a very minimum guidance from


                                                                142]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[the lecturer or instructor. The laboratory sheet is given for the open ended laboratory with
                     minimum guideline. Open ended laboratory work allows the opportunity for students to be
                     creative about the execution, analysis and evaluation of laboratory work. Students create,
                     for example, the evidence, the analysis, and the evaluation of laboratory work. Often
                     synthesis is also involved in open-ended work. These processes involve the interactive while
                     in the laboratory (in-lab work) and after leaving the laboratory (post-lab work).The students
                     are fully responsible to conduct and handle the experiment themselves after short briefing
                     given by the lecturer or the instructor. The students are working in a group of 4 to 5 persons.
                     They need to determine the objectives, apparatus and methods as well as execute the
                     experiment. A report including results, discussion, conclusion and references is submitted for
                     evaluation. The final presentation of students’ work is organized at the end of the semester.
                     Skills  such  as  communication  (oral  and  written),  organization,  teamwork,  innovation  and
                     creativity are evaluated in the open-ended laboratory approaches.


                     7.5  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING

                     Industrial training will expose students to working experience in professional bodies that is
                     related to mechanical engineering field. During industrial training, students will be able to
                     apply  theoretical  and  practical  knowledge  to  real  working  environment.  In  addition,
                     students  will  also  develop  their  soft  skills  throughout  the  training.  For  bachelor  degree
                     students,  they  should  undergo  industrial  training  for  12  weeks.  The  training  will  be
                     performed during the short semester of 3rd year study. Meanwhile, for diploma degree
                     students, they should undergo industrial training during short semester in Year 2.
